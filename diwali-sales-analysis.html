    <h2>Data Cleaning & Preparation</h2>
    <p>Before analysis, the dataset required cleaning. I used Python with Pandas to perform the following steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dropped irrelevant columns such as 'Status' and 'unnamed1'.</li>
        <li>Handled and removed missing (null) values.</li>
        <li>Corrected the data type of the 'Amount' column to ensure it was a numerical integer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This process ensured the data was clean and ready for accurate analysis.</p>

    <h3>3. Top States by Sales</h3>
